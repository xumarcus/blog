Sudoku is a well-known NP-complete problem. The rules are simple:

> Fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

With insufficient clues, multiple solutions can exist. As an extreme example, this Sudoku has no clues and has `6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960` solutions.

Sudoku is a [constraint satisfaction problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) (CSP). Sometimes solution can be deduced without repeated tries. Consider the previous puzzle (with the `7` in _d1_ removed, for sake of brevity),

We can deduce the `5` in _g4_ by observing that no other `5` can reside in the _h_-column and the _5_-th row, yet the block that _g4_ belongs to must contain exactly one `5`.

On the other hand, consider this puzzle from [Arto Inkala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arto-inkala-9651485a), which is one of the _hardest_ known Sudoku puzzles that have a _unique_ solution.

In this case, our algorithm has to **backtrack**, i.e., make an _educated_ guess on a cell's value, reject permutations that are not _consistent_ with the new value, and rinse and repeat until no cells are empty, at which point the algorithm returns the solution, or reject our latest guess and move on to another guess. A Sudoku solver should balance the number of guesses made and the time it takes to check if the guess is locally _consistent_.

# Local consistency

Judging from how long it takes the algorithm to solve, deducing `g4 = 5` in the first puzzle is easier than deducing `g6 = 5` in the second. While finding a _globally consistent_ solution takes time, we can prune the search space by considering _locally consistent_ conditions.
  - Node consistency: Constrain a node. See [here](#sudoku-as-a-csp) for an example.
  - Arc consistency: Constrain a pair.
  - Path consistency: Constrain a triple, where each pair satisfies binary constraints.
  - Generalized _n_-consistency: Constrain a _n_-let of variables to the _n_-lets of values that satisfy **_n_-ary** constraints. For example, we can deduce the `5` in _d4_ by observing that _e4_ and _f5_ form a [naked pair](http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/tech_naked.php), such that we cannot assign `8` and `9` to other cells in their block including _d4_.

There is a trade-off between complex conditions and simple conditions, since complex conditions reduce the number of tries but is computationally expensive. Usually, node or arc consistency yields the best result. This solver is therefore far from optimal in terms of speed, but solves most puzzles without backtracking.

# Implementing the solver

<Alert severity="info">See below for the actual Typescript code.</Alert>

The canonical algorithm for enforcing arc consistency is AC-3. The following pseudocode acts on `sudoku` (represented as a list of 81 bitmasks representing the 9 digits), given a `queue` of indices (up to 81) to consider. For each index in the queue we consider the constraints of its corresponding row, column and block. Looping through each type of constraint, we copy the domains of neighboring variables into `buf` and `prune_buf` it such that what that remains is _arc-consistent_.

- If it cannot be done, the sudoku has no solution.
- Then we will backtrack and make another guess if possible.
  - Most solvers will record the modifications with a stack and undo them when they backtrack, but our solver seldom backtracks, so we may as well copy the entire puzzle. It's also convenient for parallelism.
- Otherwise, we will consider the cells that have some values in its domain pruned by pushing their indices into `queue` and enforce arc consistency on the constraints they are part of again.

```python
def enforce_on(sudoku, queue):
  while queue:
    front = queue.popleft()
    for constraint_type in [ROW, COLUMN, BLOCK]:
      indices = constraint_type.neighboring_indices_of(front)
      buf = [sudoku[index] for index in indices]
      pruned_buf = prune_buf(buf)
      if pruned_buf is None:
        return False
      for (index, cell, pruned_cell) in zip(indices, buf, pruned_buf):
        if cell != pruned_cell:
          sudoku[index] = pruned_cell
          queue.push(index)
  return True
```

A key observation here is that finding a _arc-consistent_ assignment for [AllDifferent](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/12.9.0?topic=variables-all-different-constraint) constraints is equivalent to finding a perfect matching in a bipartite graph, consisting of nodes representing the cells and representing the 9 digits, and edges between each cell and the digit(s) it can possibly be. Therefore,`prune_buf` iterates over each cell and fix its `value` to one of those in its domain while leaving the rest of the cells unchanged. Then it tries to find a maximum bipartite matching with algorithms like [Hopcroft-Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm). If the matching is not _perfect_, the bit representing `value` is pruned from the corresponding cell in `buf`. Finally, if a cell has no possible values the solution for the sudoku does not exist.

```python
def prune_buf(buf):
  pruned_buf = buf.copy() # Cannot modify `buf` in loop
  for (index, cell) in enumerate(buf):
    for bit in cell.bits():
      pruned = buf.copy()
      pruned[index].unset_all_bits()
      pruned[index].set(bit)
      matching = maximum_bipartite_matching(pruned)
      if matching.cardinality() != 9: # Row/Column size
        pruned_buf[index].unset(bit)
    if pruned_buf[index].has_no_bits():
      return None
  return pruned_buf
```

While this approach is academically interesting, the standard approach on Sudoku is usually faster. This is probably due to overhead from enforcing complex conditions. However, this might change if the puzzle is larger (say, 16x16) such that parallelism overhead is comparatively low.

- Typescript [implementation](https://github.com/xumarcus/blog/blob/master/components/custom/Sudoku/worker.ts)

- Rust [implementation](https://github.com/xumarcus/sudoku). It solves Sudokus in 20ms on average on a R5 2600.

- This [t-dillon/tdoku](https://github.com/t-dillon/tdoku) is the fastest implementation I know. The author has some nice benchmarks.

- This [Emerentius/sudoku](https://github.com/Emerentius/sudoku) is a Rust library that is on par with `tdoku`.

- Ideas from [Régin, 1994](https://aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1994/AAAI94-055.pdf). In fact it describes how to shave off another order of magnitude from _Hopcroft-Karp_.
