Lecturer: Dr. Victor Tan

I can't really review this module... Lectures, tutorials and assignments are nothing of note. I didn't attend lectures and tutorials and just finished the assignments a few days after they are published. The textbook [Linear Algebra: Concepts and Techniques on Euclidean Spaces](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceclivojjo7nou2xjcno5hjglxrzom3v334pdivuhwe4kapzgo2e2o?filename=Ma%20Siu%20Lun%2C%20Ng%20Kah%20Loon%2C%20Victor%20Tan%20-%20Linear%20Algebra_%20Concepts%20and%20Techniques%20on%20Euclidean%20Spaces-McGraw-Hill%20Education%20%282016%29.pdf) contains everything one needs to know.

Exams are conducted online with MATLAB. You should prepare the code for Gram-Schmidt.

Expected A. Final A.

# Tutorials
Didn't archive. Just find some from some standard Linear Algebra text.
