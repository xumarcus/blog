I am a current Year 2 student at NUS studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I enjoy developing applications with algorithms, CTFs, programming competitions. I have previously interned at [ShopBack](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shopback-com/) and [Workforce Optimizer](https://www.linkedin.com/company/workforceoptimizer/). I have limited experience in
- [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>) (academically)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (academically)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (academically)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (academically)
- SQL ([SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/sql-server/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/))
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)

Feel free to drop me a message by [email](mailto:xumarcus.sg+blog@gmail.com) if you are looking to do business, have some questions, or just need some help.
