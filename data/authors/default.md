Hi! I am a student at NUS studying BSc CS & BSc Math. I am a jack of all trades, master of none when it comes to computers. I develop AI-powered web apps like this, join CTFs and programming competitions and intern. That's why I can do [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I know some [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) to see what's the FP hype is about. I also have some experience with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) during my internships, though most of the projects you find here are SPAs because servers are expensive.

Feel free to drop me a message by [email](mailto:xumarcus.sg+blog@gmail.com) if you are looking to do business, have some questions, or just need some help.
